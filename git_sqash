To remoev multiple commit and make a single commit out of all the commits we can use git squash.


For example:
    git reset --soft HEAD~3

    Here reset, removes all the commits mentioned after HEAD
    --soft flag only removes the commits but retains all the changes and moves then into staging.(If --heard is used, it will remove all the commits and it changes.)

    HEAD~3 It means it will remove 3 commits from head

    git commit -m "New commit msg"


    git push --force

    
    git branch
